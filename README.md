# Phase 3 FavAnime Project 
An anime list app where users can review & rate their favorite animes, post new animes, delete reviews, and edit reviews.

- Built a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend
  

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.
